Module "LEDR"      (component LED)
   - LEDR_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LEDR_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LEDR_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LEDR_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LEDR_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDR_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LEDR_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LEDR_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "KSDK1"     (component KinetisSDK)

Module "LEDG"      (component LED)
   - LEDG_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LEDG_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LEDG_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LEDG_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LEDG_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDG_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LEDG_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LEDG_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "LEDB"      (component LED)
   - LEDB_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LEDB_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LEDB_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LEDB_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LEDB_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDB_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LEDB_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LEDB_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.
